    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish made with basmati rice, succulent chicken, and a blend of
        spices. Originating from the Indian subcontinent, this dish is known for its rich taste and layered cooking
        technique. The chicken is marinated in yogurt and spices like turmeric, cumin, coriander, and garam masala, then
        cooked with onions, tomatoes, and fragrant saffron-infused rice.

        The biryani is traditionally cooked using the dum method, where the ingredients are slow-cooked in a sealed pot,
        allowing the flavors to meld together. Garnished with fried onions, fresh coriander, and mint leaves, it is
        often served with raita (yogurt sauce) and salad. This dish is a perfect balance of spice, tenderness, and
        aroma, making it a beloved delicacy across various cultures.
